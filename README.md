# TicTacToe
Game of Tic Tac Toe between Player and Computer is displayed using a GUI.


This program creates a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the player plays against the computer. 
The game is displayed using a GUI created with the Tkinter library. 

Program Includes: 
1. A "Play Again" button that allows the player to start a new game after the current game is over.
2. A "Quit" button that closes the program.
3. Settings drop down menu for background color
4. Display for computer: "computer wins" 
5. Display for player: "you win".


To run program: 

1. Have Python Installed 
2. Download file: game.py
3. Open up a terminal and go to the dicretory where the file is and type: "python3 game.py"

What I plan to add in the future: 

1. Sound effects that will play when either computer/user wins/loses
3. Number of Games played
4. Number of Wins/Loses for Computer/User
